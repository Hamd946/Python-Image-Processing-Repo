Python Image Processing Project

Overview:
This Python project implements several key image processing techniques, including background removal, image insertion on a new background, Gaussian blurring, convolution, and upsampling/downsampling. The project is built using common libraries like OpenCV and NumPy, and can be used for various image manipulation tasks.

Features:
Background Removal: Remove the background from an image, isolating the foreground subject.
Insert Image on New Background: Replace the background of an image with a new one after removing the original background.
Gaussian Blurring: Apply Gaussian blur to smooth images and reduce noise.
Convolution: Perform convolution on images using custom kernels to apply filters such as edge detection, sharpening, etc.
Upsampling and Downsampling: Increase or decrease the resolution of an image using interpolation techniques.

Technologies Used:
Python.
PIL: for accessing images and performing manipulations on it such as conversion to grayscale.
NumPy: For handling image data and mathematical operations.
Matplotlib (optional): For visualizing images and processing steps.

How to use:
extract the zipped folder, open folder in vscode and run the notebooks.
